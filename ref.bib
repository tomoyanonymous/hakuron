  abstract  = {This article traces the history and evolution of Music Programming , from the early off-line synthesis programs of the MUSIC N family to modern realtime interactive systems. It explores the main design characteristics of these systems and their impact on Computer Music. In chronological fashion, the article will examine, with code examples, the development of the early systems into the most common modern languages currently in use. In particular, we will focus on Csound, highlighting its main internal aspects and its applications. The text will also explore the various paradigms that have oriented the design and use of music programming systems. This discussion is completed by a consideration of computer music ecosystems and their pervasiveness in today's practice.},

  abstract = {ChucK is a programming language designed for computer music. It aims to be expressive and straightforward to read and write with respect to time and concurrency, and to provide a platform for precise audio synthesis and analysis and for rapid experimentation in computer music. In particular, ChucK defines the notion of a strongly timed audio programming language, comprising a versatile time-based programming model that allows programmers to flexibly and precisely control the flow of time in code and use the keyword now as a time-aware control construct, and gives programmers the ability to use the timing mechanism to realize sample-accurate concurrent programming. Several case studies are presented that illustrate the workings, properties, and personality of the language. We also discuss applications of ChucK in laptop orchestras, computer music pedagogy, and mobile music instruments. Properties and affordances of the language and its future directions are outlined.},

We describe eight recurring patterns that we have identified as being used for DSL design and implementation. Existing languages can be extended, restricted, partially used, or become hosts for DSLS. Simple DSLS can be implemented by lexical processing. In addition, DSLS can be used to create front-ends to existing systems or to express complicated data structures. Finally, DSLS can be combined using process pipelines. The patterns described form a pattern language that can be used as a building block for a systematic view of the software development process involving DSLS. {\textcopyright} 2001 Elsevier Science Inc.

The first of these systems, Sonic Pi, aims at teaching core computing notions to school students using live-coded music as a means of stimulating and maintaining student engagement. We describe how an emphasis on a functional style improves the ease in which core computer science concepts can be communicated to students. Secondly we describe Overtone, a functional language and live coding environment aimed towards professional electronic musicians. We describe how Overtone's abstractions and architecture strongly benefit from a functional-oriented implementation. Both Sonic Pi and Overtone are freely available open-source platforms.},

  abstract  = {We introduce MetaML, a statically-typed multi-stage programming language extending Nielson and Nielson's two stage notation to an arbitrary number of stages. MetaML extends previous work by introducing four distinct staging annotations which generalize those published previously [25, 12, 7, 6] We give a static semantics in which type checking is done once and for all before the first stage, and a dynamic semantics which introduces a new concept of cross-stage persistence, which requires that variables available in any stage are also available in all future stages. We illustrate that staging is a manual form of binding time analysis. We explain why, even in the presence of automatic binding time analysis, explicit annotations are useful, especially for programs with more than two stages. A thesis of this paper is that multi-stage languages are useful as programming languages in their own right, and should support features that make it possible for programmers to write staged computations without significantly changing their normal programming style. To illustrate this we provide a simple three stage example, and an extended two-stage example elaborating a number of practical issues.},

  abstract  = {With few exceptions, macros have traditionally been viewed as operations on syntax trees or even on plain strings. This view makes macros seem ad hoc, and is at odds with two desirable features of contemporary typed functional languages: static typing and static scoping. At a deeper level, there is a need for a simple, usable semantics for macros. This paper argues that these problems can be addressed by formally viewing macros as multi-stage computations. This view eliminates the need for freshness conditions and tests on variable names, and provides a compositional interpretation that can serve as a basis for designing a sound type system for languages supporting macros, or even for compilation. To illustrate our approach, we develop and present MacroML, an extension of ML that supports inlining, recursive macros, and the definition of new binding constructs. The latter is subtle, and is the most novel addition in a statically typed setting. The semantics of a core subset of MacroML is given by an interpretation into MetaML, a statically-typed multi-stage programming language. It is then easy to show that MacroML is stage- and type-safe: macro expansion does not depend on runtime evaluation, and both stages do not "go wrong". Copyright 2001 ACM.},

The computer should ideally feel in the musician's hands like a musical instrument, needing only to be tuned and then played.

In this article we examine the ways in which computer music languages might similarly influence the aesthetic decisions of the digital music practitioner, even when those languages are designed for generality and theoretically capable of implementing any sound-producing process. We examine the basis for querying the non-neutrality of tools with a particular focus on the concept of idiomaticity: patterns of instruments or languages which are particularly easy or natural to execute in comparison to others. We then present correspondence with the developers of several major music programming languages and a survey of digital musical instrument creators examining the relationship between idiomatic patterns of the language and the characteristics of the resulting instruments and pieces. In an open-ended creative domain, asserting causal relationships is difficult and potentially inappropriate, but we find a complex interplay between language, instrument, piece and performance that suggests that the creator of the music programming language should be considered one party to a creative conversation that occurs each time a new instrument is designed.},

@article{Puckette2015,
  abstract = {The fundamental principle of Computer Music is usually taken to be the Nyquist Theorem, which, in its usually cited form, states that a band-limited function can be exactly represented by sampling it at regular intervals. This paper will not quarrel with the theorem itself, but rather will test the assump-tions under which it is commonly applied, and endeavor to show that there are interesting approaches to computer music that lie outside the framework of the sampling theorem. As we will see in Section 3, sampling violations are ubiquitous in every-day electronic music practice. The severity of these violations can usually be mitigated either through various engineering practices and/or careful critical lis-tening. But their existence gives the lie to the popular understanding of digital audio practice as being " lossless " . This is not to deny the power of modern digital signal processing theory and its applications, but rather to claim that its underlying assumption—that the sampled signals on which we are operating are to be thought of as exactly rep-resenting band-limited continuous-time functions—sheds light on certain digital operations (notably time-invariant filtering) but not so aptly on others, such as classical synthesizer waveform generation. Digital audio practitioners cannot escape the necessity of representing contin-uous-time signals with finite-sized data structures. But the blanket assumption that such signals can only be represented via the sampling theorem can be unnecessarily limiting. In Sections 4 and 6 I'll describe investigations by two recent UCSD graduates that each adopt a distinct approach to audio manipu-lation outside the framework of the sampling theorem. A collection of accompanying patches that demonstrate some of these ideas can be downloaded from msp.ucsd.edu/ideas/icmc15-examples/. 1 1 The assumptions Band-limited functions are a vector space: you can scale one of them, or add two of them, to get another. But that is where closure ends. The trouble begins as soon as we even go so far as to multiply one signal by another. Suppose two sampled signals, X[n] and Y [n], are used to represent two continuous functions of time x(t), y(t), which we assume to be band-limited, containing only frequen-cies in the Nyquist frequency band, the interval (−R/2, R/2) where R is the sample rate. The values can either be real or complex, and for simplicity we'll assume the computer can exactly represent the numerical values. (It isn't true but that is usually a comparatively minor issue). There is, of course, a perfectly good continuous-time signal, call it z(t), that is represented by the computable product, Z[n] = X[n]Y [n]. But it's not in general the case that z(t) = x(t)y(t). We didn't in reality make the product of the two continuous-time signals we were representing when we multiplied their computer representations. At this point we can look ruefully back at every occurrence of the character " * " in all the Csound, Pd, SuperCollider, Kyma, 4X, or MUSIC 10 instruments we've ever built and reflect on the fact that the result isn't really correct, if we regard our sampled signals as representing continuous-time ones. Often it's a very serviceable approximation. If, for instance, the signals x(t) and y(t) have frequency limits whose sum is less than R/2, the multiplication is exact; and when not exact, it is often a very good approximation. But the approximation's accuracy or lack thereof is rarely worked out explicitly. We could always take action to band-limit two signals (by filtering them) before multiplying so that the multiplication itself doesn't yield frequencies out-side the Nyquist frequency band. But this would cause delays and/or phase distortion, not to mention the computational cost this would incur. One fundamental operation in electronic music practice (in my thinking, the most fundamental one) is table lookup, which is used in digital oscillators and samplers, and also in nonlinear techniques such as FM and waveshaping. Again sidestepping the comparatively minor issue of the accuracy limits of wavetable lookup, we instead again consider the possibility of frequency products landing outside the Nyquist band. Suppose the incoming signal is a sinusoid of frequency $\omega$ and that the wavetable lookup can be approximated as a power series, f (x) = a 0 + a 1 x + a 2 x 2 + {\textperiodcentered} {\textperiodcentered} {\textperiodcentered}},

A human performer generates input events using the input devices. The CMPS responds to these events by computing and performing sequences of output actions whose intended timing is determined algorithmically. Because of the need for accurate timing of output actions, the scheduling requirements of a CMPS differ from those of general-purpose or conventional real-time systems. This paper describes the scheduling facilities of FORMULA, a CMPS used by many musicians. In addition to providing accurate timing of output action sequences, FORMULA provides other basic functions useful in musical applications: (1) per-process virtual time systems with independent relationships to real time; (2) process grouping mechanisms and language-level control structures with time-related semantics, and (3) integrated scheduling of tasks (such as compiling and editing) whose real-time constraints are less stringent than those of output action computations. {\textcopyright} 1990, ACM.

Artists with experience in programming have demonstrated the unique creative opportunities of using code to make art. Currently, manual artists interested in using procedural techniques must undergo the difficult process of learning to program, and must adopt tools and practices far removed from those to which they are accustomed. We hypothesize that, through the right direct manipulation interface, we can enable accessible and expressive procedural art creation. To explore this, we developed Para, a digital illustration tool that supports the creation of declarative constraints in vector artwork. Para's constraints enable procedural relationships while facilitating live manual control and non-linear editing. Constraints can be combined with duplication behaviors and ordered collections of artwork to produce complex, dynamic compositions. We use the results of two open-ended studies with professional artists and designers to provide guidelines for accessible tools that integrate manual and procedural expression.},

@article{Magnusson2009,
  abstract = {This paper explores the differences in the design and performance of acoustic and new digital musical instruments, arguing that with the latter there is an increased encapsulation of musical theory. The point of departure is the phenomenology of musical instruments, which leads to the exploration of designed artefacts as extensions of human cognition - as scaffolding onto which we delegate parts of our cognitive processes. The paper succinctly emphasises the pronounced epistemic dimension of digital instruments when compared to acoustic instruments. Through the analysis of material epistemologies it is possible to describe the digital instrument as an epistemic tool: a designed tool with such a high degree of symbolic pertinence that it becomes a system of knowledge and thinking in its own terms. In conclusion, the paper rounds up the phenomenological and epistemological arguments, and points at issues in the design of digital musical instruments that are germane due to their strong aesthetic implications for musical culture. {\textcopyright} 2009 Cambridge University Press.},

  abstract  = {Programming languages researchers make a variety of different kinds of claims about the design of languages and related tools and calculi. Each type of claim requires different kinds of reasons and evidence to justify. Claims regarding the aesthetics or elegance of a design, or its effects on people, are especially tricky to justify because they are less strictly defined and thus are subject to change depending on the exact audience. In this essay, we take an interdisciplinary approach to this problem by drawing on the fields of argument theory and rhetorical analysis to develop a framework for justifying audience-dependent claims. In particular, we argue that researchers should provide descriptions of specific features of their systems that connect to effects on audience in order to justify these claims. To demonstrate this framework, we show several examples of how this is already being practiced in some programming languages research, and conclude by calling for authors to provide descriptive evidence to bolster such claims and to frame and strengthen other evaluation methods such as user studies.},

  abstract = {While still a relatively young field, computer science has a vast body of knowledge in the domain of programming languages. When a new language is introduced, its designers make claims which distinguish their language from previous languages. However, it often feels like language designers do not feel a pressing need to back these claims with evidence beyond personal anecdotes. Peer reviewers are likely to agree. In this paper, we present preliminary work which revisits the history of such claims by examining a number of language design papers which span the history of programming language development. We focus on the issue of claim-evidence correspondence, or determining how often claims are or are not backed by evidence. These preliminary results confirm that unsupported claims have been around since the inception of higher level programming in the 1950s. We stake a position that this behavior is unacceptable for the health of the research community. We should be more aware of valiant and effective efforts for supplying evidence to support language design claims. {\textcopyright} 2010 ACM.},

In the first, I review two influential theories from the Philosophy of Science to help reflect on the nature of design theory, concluding that research through design is likely to produce theories that are provisional, contingent, and aspirational. In the second part, I discuss three possible interpretations for the diversity of approaches to research through design, and suggest that this variation need not be seen as a sign of inadequate standards or a lack of cumulative progress in the field, but may be natural for a generative endeavour. In the final section, I suggest that, rather than aiming to develop increasingly comprehensive theories of design, practice based research might better view theory as annotation of realised design examples, and particularly portfolios of related pieces. Overall, I suggest that the design research community should be wary of impulses towards convergence and standardisation, and instead take pride in its aptitude for exploring and speculating, particularising and diversifying, and-especially-its ability to manifest the results in the form of new, conceptually rich artefacts.},

  abstract     = {The core question addressed by this invited keynote and conference paper is how fictions are designed to negotiate, critique and realise the multiplicity of possible new technological futures. Focusing on methods, processes and strategies the presentation initially describes how things/technologies become products, employing the perspective of domestication to describe the transition from extraordinary to everyday. This development suggests a product history, a traceable lineage that goes back through generations, each one a small iteration of the previous. By modelling this lineage, design fictions can do two things: 1. Project current emerging technological development to create Speculative Futures: hypothetical products of tomorrow. 2. Break free of the lineage to speculate on Alternative Presents. These fictions effectively act as cultural litmus paper, either offering vignettes of how it might be to live with the technology in question or challenging contemporary applications of technology through demonstrable alternatives. The presentation focused on how these two types of fiction are created, how they differ from science fiction, other modes of future thinking and technological critique - more specifically how both methodologies utilise designed artefacts. What informs the development, aesthetics, behaviour, interactions and function of these objects? Once created, how and where do they operate? How can we gauge and understand their impact and meaning? As a consequence of the presentation Auger was invited to run workshops and projects in Basel (Hochschule für Gestaltung und Kunst) and {HEAD} (Haute école d?art et de design), Geneva and is advising on the design of a new masters programme at the Basel Hochschule.},

The aim of the project is to embody a "present" by re-reading the history with practices. By utilizing the literature of media archaeology as our foothold, we firstly deepen our understanding of the role and function of various media, especially in the field of audio and visual, before their stabilization in the history. Then, we apply each acquired notion as a technique for diverse aesthetic practices in the era of personal fabrication. Instead of depicting the future or excavating the past, we try to redefine the reality of our circumstances by producing the alternatives. In this presentation, through the particular works of those techniques, we summarize the activities of this project based on related materials that focus on introducing the details of the exhibition shown at the {NTT} Intercommunication Center's ({ICC}) Open Space 2015.},

Drawing on feminist traditions of situated knowing, we designed an electronic quilt and a series of participatory workshops that materialize the work of the core memory weavers. With this case we not only broaden dominant stories of design, but we also reflect on the entanglement of predominantly male, high status labor with the ostensibly low-status work of women’s hands. By integrating design and archival research as a means of cultural analysis, we further expand conversations on design research methods within human-computer interaction ({HCI}), using design to reveal legacies of practice elided by contemporary technology cultures. In doing so, this paper highlights for {HCI} scholars that worlds of handwork and computing, or weaving and space travel, are not as separate as we might imagine them to be.},

  abstract  = {First edition. Includes index. "Springing from the febrile mind of mathematician Norbert Wiener amid the devastation of World War {II}, the cybernetic vision underpinned a host of seductive myths about the future of machines. This vision would radically transform the postwar world, ushering in sweeping cultural change. From the Cold War's monumental {SAGE} bomber defense system to enhanced humans, Wiener's scheme turned computers from machines of assured destruction into engines of brilliant utopias. Cybernetics triggered blissful cults, the Whole Earth Catalog, and feminist manifestos, just as it fueled martial gizmos and the air force's foray into virtual space. As Rid shows, Cybernetics proved a powerful tool for two competing factions-- those who sought to make a better world and those who sought to control the one at hand. In the Bay Area, techno-libertarians embraced networked machines as the portal to a new electronic frontier: a peaceful, open space of freedom. In Washington, {DC}, cyberspace provided the perfect theater for dominance and war.

The strategies employed thus far have been based on an understanding of sound that leads to either an arbitrary or metaphorical relation between the sounds used and the data to be represented. In this article, an alternative approach to the use of sound in computer interfaces is outlined, one that emphasizes the role of sound in conveying information about the world to the listener. According to this approach, auditory icons, caricatures of naturally occurring sounds, could be used to provide information about sources of data. Auditory icons provide a natural way to represent dimensional data as well as conceptual objects in a computer system. They allow categorization of data into distinct families, using a single sound. Perhaps the most important advantage of this strategy is that it is based on the way people listen to the world in their everyday lives.},

We build on the philosophy of Larry Laudan, who develops problem and solution as the foundational concepts of science. We argue that most {HCI} research is about three main types of problem: empirical, conceptual, and constructive. We elaborate upon Laudan’s concept of problem-solving capacity as a universal criterion for determining the progress of solutions (outcomes): Instead of asking whether research is ‘valid’ or follows the ‘right’ approach, it urges us to ask how its solutions advance our capacity to solve important problems in human use of computers. This offers a rich, generative, and ‘discipline-free’ view of {HCI} and resolves some existing debates about what {HCI} is or should be. It may also help unify efforts across nominally disparate traditions in empirical research, theory, design, and engineering.},

Representing structures in music such as repetitive occurrences of a common phrase or its variation is supported with macros and phrase transformation modules. The interpreter enables us to execute its program code interactively with a read-eval-play loop. The interpreter can also be used for the real-time processing of {MIDI} events coming from input devices. The language is extensible in that C functions can be called from its program code.},

Non-standard sound synthesis has been neglected in modern research programmes concentrated on spectral and physical modelling synthesis. Its goal is not the modelling and reproduction of sounds from perceptual or physical acoustical data but the potential of any algorithm, cast into the audio range. Yet where the composer seeks novel sound generation and control possibilities, much interesting territory remains available to explore in the context of what might be termed errant sound synthesis.},

The proposed algebra is based on three binary operations of construction : sequential, parallel and recursive constructions.

Algebraic representations have interesting application for visual languages based on block diagrams and are useful to specify the formal semantic of these languages.},

The tasks of emulating a 64-voice orchestra plus real-time {MPEG} decode, live voice tracking with pitch and tempo following, and a full range of audio effects processing are represented in a network of active objects which are just-in-time serviced by a co-operating array of {SIMD} {DSPs}.},

This paper seeks to illuminate some of the historical precedents to the scene, its primary aesthetic goals, and the divergent technological and musical approaches of representative participants. We keep in mind the novel possibilities in musical expression explored by algoravers. The scene is by no means homogeneous, and the very lack of uniformity of technique, from new live coding languages through code {DJing} to plug-in combination, with or without visual extension, is indicative of the flexibility of computers themselves as general information processors.},

The goal is to create an amalgam that plays to the strengths of each language, giving rise to new possibilities for rapid prototyping, interaction design and controller mapping, pedagogy, and new ways of working with both {FAUST} and {CHUCK}. We present our motivations, approach, implementation, and preliminary evaluation. {FAUCK} is open-source and freely available.},
